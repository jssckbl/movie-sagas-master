Movie Sagas

## Description

Movie Sagas provides a list of 14 movies upon page load. Each movie is represented by a movie poster image, title of movie, and a description. When the movie poster image is clicked, the user has an opportunity to either edit the information, or be returned to the list, both options via separate buttons. 

If the user chooses to edit the movie information, they will be directed to an edit page. This allows an input for the Movie Title, and/or a text area for the Description. User has the option to Save or Cancel the edit via separate buttons. If edits are saved, the information will then be updated in the database.
