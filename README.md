# Project Name

Movie Sagas

## Description

Movie Sagas provides a list of 14 movies upon page load. Each movie is represented by a movie poster image, title of movie, and a description. When the movie poster image is clicked, the user has an opportunity to either edit the information, or be returned to the list, both options via separate buttons. 

If the user chooses to edit the movie information, they will be directed to an edit page. This allows an input for the Movie Title, and/or a text area for the Description. User has the option to Save or Cancel the edit via separate buttons. If edits are saved, the information will then be updated in the database.

## Installation

Create a database named "saga-movies-weekend".

The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. It is recommended to use Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.

- Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
- Run npm run server in your terminal
- Run npm run client in your terminal
- The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
